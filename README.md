Predict which college football players will become NFL players

To-Do
0. Get SR-nfl data

1. Fix mistakes

2. Find how to host large data sets on github (design this for export)

3. Test Bill Parcell's Theory on Drafting Quarterbacks
He must be a senior, because you need time and maturity to develop into a good professional quarterback.
He must be a graduate, because you want someone who takes his responsibilities seriously.
He must be a three-year starter, because you need to make sure his success wasnâ€™t ephemeral and that he has lived as "the guy" for some period of time.
He must have at least 23 wins, because the big passing numbers must come in the context of winning games.
